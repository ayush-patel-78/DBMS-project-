# DBMS Lab Project (IV Semester) - Social Media Backend
This project is created by a group of students from IIIT, Bhopal as a graded project for our fourth semster Database Managment Systems Lab evaluation. It is a simple backend project aimed to improve our mysql skills.

## Description
* **Absract:-** <br/>
We all use social media applications in our daily life, sometimes even too much. Due to their large user base, there arises a need for an efficient backend which we are aiming to replicate in a small extent.
The backend stores data such as login details, user details, follower details etc. The main challenge is to have an effective relationship between the tables to get the required data. Which we are hoping to solve in this project.

* **Objective:-** <br/>
The main objective of any social media platform is to connect users all across the world to different users and communities based on their interests. Social media applications also act as a hub for discussions and a place to know the latest trends of the world. 
The project is aimed to create the master file of the backend and is thus requires for administrative privileges to gain access. This project will provide a small scale implementation to better learn the information storage of these platforms. 

* **Functional Requiement**
    * New users can create  new accounts, and the existing users can login once their account is verified.
    * Users can upload content (posts) that can be bookmarked and commented by other users
    * Each post and the subsequent comments have their own likes and share count and data. 
    * The posts are further divided into photos and videos, and also contain the hashtags used.
    * Each user can have a list of followers along with a list of friends. Users can also see others that are following them.
    * Hashtags are also used to sort out liked content and further help in recommendation.
